The following payment terms and conditions govern your financial arrangement with (“Office”).

•You have read, fully understand and authorize the services in your Treatment Summary. You agree you are financially responsible for your share of the cost of all treatment started.
•You understand that you are entering into a contract with Office through which you agree to pay for your share of the cost of the services provided by Office as set forth in your Treatment Summary.
•You have been presented treatment options, where applicable, and fees in regard to your treatment alternatives, including covered benefit(s), where applicable.
•To the extent you have chosen a service that is outside your insurance plan, dental benefits or discount dental plan (collectively, your “Insurance/Plan”), you understand that this treatment will be considered optional, alternate, not covered or cosmetic by your Insurance/Plan, and therefore your share of the cost for such services may be higher than the covered benefit.
•You understand that as your treatment progresses, your dentist may determine in consultation with you or due to necessity that different or additional treatment is necessary and your financial responsibility may change. You understand that, whenever possible, you will be informed of any changes in advance and presented with a new Treatment Summary for approval.
•If Office requires a deposit, you understand that such deposit will be applied toward the services listed in your approved Treatment Summary. If there is a change to the Treatment Summary and the deposit does not get applied as authorized, such deposit will be applied toward future approved Treatment Summaries or refunded in accordance with Office’s policies in effect from time to time.
•You understand that the payment authorized in your Treatment Summary will be made when the applicable service from your approved Treatment Summary is marked complete by your dentist.
•To the extent you have secondary insurance, you understand that your cost share is an estimate based on Office’s contracted rate, your remaining benefits and any limitations and/or exclusions of your coverage. This agreement does not constitute a coverage guarantee by your Insurance/Plan. You agree to be fully responsible if your Insurance/Plan does not pay its estimated amount for any reason and you understand that this may increase your expense. Once your Insurance/Plan adjudicates your claim, if your patient share was overestimated or underestimated, you will be refunded or charged by Office for the difference.
