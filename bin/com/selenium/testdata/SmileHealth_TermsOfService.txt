  Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law principles. Except for the optional arbitration described below, the parties will resolve any disputes in the courts of Orange County, California.
Excluding claims for equitable relief, if the total amount in dispute is less than $10,000, either party may elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration by initiating arbitration through an established provider that is agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration must be conducted under the following rules: (1) at the choice of the party seeking relief, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online or solely on written submissions, (2) no party or witness will make any personal appearance unless the parties agree otherwise, and (3) the winning party may have the arbitrator’s award entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Whether in court or in arbitration, the initiating party must bring all claims in its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in a class action or other similar proceeding.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SMILE HEALTH AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE PERMANENTLY BANNED.
