Wellfit Privacy Policy
Last Revised: August 2, 2018


General. PDS Innovations, LLC, or its successor Patolus Operations, LLC DBA Wellfit (the “Company”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from Users of our online portal, online bill pay, and/or mobile application (each, an “Application” and the services available therein the “Services”).  The Services enable patients (each, a “Member”) and other users of the Services (collectively, “Users”) to pay for dental services in accordance with the treatment summary determined by their provider of dental services (each, a “Dental Provider”) and approved by the User. If applicable, the Member's share of payment will be determined in accordance with the terms of their dental discount plan or a dental benefit plan offered by their employer (each, a “Plan”). Through the Services, the Dental Providers whose dental practices (“Sub-Merchants”) have been approved by a Plan, if applicable, and the Company, may submit treatment summaries and costs to Members. Members may pay the Sub-Merchants for their Dental Provider's services through approved payment sources linked to the Member's Account. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any protected health information (“PHI”) (as defined by the Health Insurance Protectability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended) that may be disclosed by Dental Providers or Sub-Merchants to the Company, which will be governed by a separate Business Associate Agreement between the Company and the Dental Provider or Sub-Merchant. Terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the General Terms.

A Note About Children. We do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to the Company and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

Types of Data We Collect. We collect personal information from Users, as described below.
Information You Provide to Us.
We collect and store the information you give to us when using our Services. We may collect personal information from you and your dependents, including those dependents under age eighteen (18), such as first and last name, e-mail, home address, zip code, phone number, date of birth, username and password when you create an account to log in to our Services (“Account”), as well as your payment information when you use our online bill pay, such as credit card type, credit card number, credit card expiration date and billing zip code (your “Bill Pay Information”). If you purchase a Plan membership or pay for dental services through our Services, we collect and store information about the transaction for your future transactions. This can include your payment information (including credit card, HSA, FSA or ACH information), purchase activity and contact details.
If you are a Member, the information you upload about yourself, including your name, age, and gender, as well as the type of payment method(s) you have associated with your Account will be saved to your profile (“Profile”).
To the extent necessary to provide the Services, a User's payment method or information may be disclosed to a trusted partner, such as Vantiv, LLC, or Fifth Third Bank, or a successor thereof, or Visa, MasterCard, Discover or any other card organization or third party vendor (all of the foregoing, the “Third Party Vendors”).
In addition, we will collect each Member's treatment code(s) associated with any procedure you inquire about or obtain from any Dental Provider via the Services. As a Member, you acknowledge and agree that you and your dependents will share certain PHI with the Company during the course of the Services. Your PHI may be used by a Dental Provider to create a Treatment Summary, by Company for the approval of the Treatment Summary via SMS to the phone number listed in your Account, and via e-mail notifications to the e-mail address listed in your Account. To the extent necessary to deal with a dispute, chargeback, compliance case or other issue with a Third Party Vendor, Company may be required to share a User's PHI with such Third Party Vendor. In such event, only the minimum amount of PHI will be shared in order to resolve the dispute, chargeback, compliance case or other issue.
If you are a Dental Provider, we will collect the pricing information you make available via the Services regarding the costs of certain dental procedures (“Pricing Information”).
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
If you sign up for our newsletter, we will collect your email address.
When you participate in any survey on our Services, we will collect your answers and add it to your profile.
If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on our Services, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last name, and sometimes postal address to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.
We also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected.
Information Collected via Technology.
Log Files. As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track Users' movements around the Applications, gather demographic information about our User base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our Users' needs. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.
Mobile Services.  We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded any of our Applications. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Applications, and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications.
Cookies.Like many online services, we may use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
Pixel Tag. In addition, we may use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a User's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages and emails. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format Users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our Users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
Traffic Analytics.  We may use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how Users use the Services and Members utilize their benefits (“Analytics Companies”). These Analytics Companies uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services, and what features they use on our Applications. We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies to improve our Applications and Services. These Analytics Companies collect the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information. Although these Analytics Companies may place a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique User the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these Analytics Companies.
Information Provided by Your Employer.
We will gather information from your Employer or Plan for purposes including determining Member eligibility, benefits plan determinations and dependent status. Such information may include personal information such as your first name, last name, date of birth, social security number, salary, place and location of employment, gender, contact information (phone number, physical address, e-mail address), PHI, Employer specific dates (hire, re-hire, termination) and occupation.
