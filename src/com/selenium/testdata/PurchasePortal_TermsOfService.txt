Last revised on: August 2, 2018
  THESE TERMS OF USE (THE “GENERAL TERMS”) INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND A WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS, AND REQUIRE BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES (EACH AS DEFINED BELOW). THE GENERAL TERMS LIMIT THE REMEDIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE. BY ENTERING INTO THESE GENERAL TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW. PLEASE SEE SECTION 11(f) BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING ARBITRATION AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM A PROCEEDING IN A COURT OF LAW .
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THESE TERMS.
THE GENERAL TERMS LIMIT THE REMEDIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
  These General Terms are a legal agreement between you (“you, “your”) and PDS Innovations, LLC or its successor Patolus Operations, LLC DBA Wellfit (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) and governs your use of our online portal, online bill pay, and/or mobile applications (each, an “Application” and the services available therein the “Services”). The Services enable patients (each, a “Member”) and general users of our online bill pay (each, a “Bill Pay User”) to pay for dental services in accordance with the treatment summary determined by their provider of dental services (each, a “Dental Provider”) and approved by the Member or Bill Pay User. If applicable, the Member’s or Bill Pay User’s share of payment will be determined in accordance with the terms of their dental discount plan or a dental benefit plan offered by their employer (each, a “Plan”). Through the Services, the Dental Providers whose dental practices (“Sub-Merchants”) have been approved by a Plan, if applicable, and the Company, may submit treatment summaries and costs to Members. Members then pay the Sub-Merchant for the Dental Provider’s services through approved payment sources linked to the Member’s Account. Sub-Merchants and/or Dental Providers may also identify certain individuals to have administrative or other practice user responsibilities (“Practice Users”). Bill Pay Users, Dental Providers, Members, Practice Users and any other individuals who use the Services are each referred to as a “User” for the purposes of the General Terms. The following General Terms apply to all Users. By using any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within, including terms that limit our liability (see Section 8) and require arbitration (see Section 11.1). You also agree to any additional terms specific to the Services you use, such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us. You should read all of our terms carefully. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM ANY DENTAL SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A DENTAL OFFICE.
  ·      Sub-Merchant Supplemental Terms . If you are the owner or officer of a Sub-Merchant, your use of the Services is also subject to the Sub-Merchant Supplemental Terms (“Sub-Merchant Supplemental Terms”).
·      Dental Provider Supplemental Terms . If you are a Dental Provider, your use of the Services is also subject to the Dental Provider Supplemental Terms (“Dental Provider Supplemental Terms”).
·      Member Supplemental Terms . If you are a Member, your use of the Services is also subject to the Member Terms (the “Member Terms”).
·      Bill Pay User Supplemental Terms . If you are a Bill Pay User, your use of the Services is also subject to the Bill Pay User Terms (“Bill Pay User Terms”).
·      Privacy Policy . You acknowledge and agree that the rights and obligations of all Users of and about the personal information of Users collected, used and disclosed by the Company in connection with the Services, is governed by the Company’s Privacy Policy.
  If the General Terms are inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control. The General Terms and any applicable Supplemental Terms are referred to herein as the “Terms.”

THE TERM “YOU” REFERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY, AS APPLICABLE, IDENTIFIED AS THE USER WHEN YOU REGISTERED TO USE THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE GENERAL TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES . If you are an owner or officer of an employer offering an employer-sponsored Plan (“Employer”), any written and pen-signed agreement you have entered into with the Company regarding the subject matter hereof will supersede these Terms to the extent of any direct conflict.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE COMPANY IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME . When changes are made, the Company will make a new copy of the General Terms available within the online portal or the online bill pay and any new Supplemental Terms will be made available from within, or through, the affected Service within the online portal or the online bill pay. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the General Terms. You acknowledge that the Company will not provide prior notice to the extent a change in terms or conditions is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an EFT or other system or account; provided, however, to the extent any change is permanent, notice will be given in accordance herewith. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new users of the Services and all Bill Pay Users and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting notice of such changes on the online portal for existing users, provided that any material changes shall be effective for users who have an Account with us upon the earlier of thirty (30) days after posting notice of such changes on the online portal or thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to Registered Users (defined in Section 1.1 below). The Company may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Services is permitted.

  11.            General
11.1          Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with the Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
(a)             Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, you agree that you will not bring a class action claim in small claims court. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
(b)             Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution . Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 17020 Red Hill Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614; Attention: Legal Department. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
(c)             Arbitration Rules. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: National Registered Agents, Inc. of NV, 701 S. Carson Street, Suite 200, Carson City, NV 89701. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ( “Arbitration Rules” ) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in Orange County, California, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek less than $500 in damages and comply with the Terms, including the Notice Requirement, the Company shall reimburse you for your AAA filing fee, and shall pay all administration and arbitrator fees up to a total amount of $500. If the Arbitrator grants you an award, the Company will reimburse your attorneys’ fees.
(d)             Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration . If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
(e)             Authority of Arbitrator . If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
(f)              Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(g)             Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions . ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If , however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement or Terms, neither you or the Company is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 11(m).
(h)             Confidentiality . All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
(i)              Severability . If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
(j)              Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
(k)             Survival of Agreement . This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Company.
(l)              Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
(m)           Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Orange County, California, for such purpose.
11.2          Consumer Complaints . In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
