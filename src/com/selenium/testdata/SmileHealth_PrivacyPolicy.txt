Additionally, Smile Health may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet their targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. Smile Health does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Smile Health advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
Cookies
Smile Health may set and access Site cookies on your computer. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Site cookies. Smile Health uses web beacons to access Site cookies inside and outside of our network of websites and in connection with Smile Health products and services.
Smile Health may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Site, and it may also allow the companies that show advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their own cookies on your computer. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. These cookies are set and subsequently accessed on a user’s computer after the user interacts with, views, or clicks on a targeted ad. If you do not wish to have other companies’ cookies set on your computer, do not interact with, view or click on the targeted ads. These other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy, and as such, their privacy policy may materially differ in both form and substance from this Privacy Policy.

Confidentiality and Security
We limit access to the personal information about you within our company to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information in order to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Any information collected by Smile Health is stored using security procedures and practices that we believe are appropriate to the nature of the information. However, no online storage or data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit using our Site.
